About
=========================

CodeCommunity is a website created by developers for developers, a community where developers can share questions and solutions bringing every developer on earth together.
Because every developer on earth doesnt know what they're doing (most of the time at least).
So why study the documentation or debug for hours when you can get help by other developers?
Simply put there is no other reason, this is the best solution for all your problems.

The developer of this webpage (Christian Norrman) is a student of "Blekinge Tekniska Universitet" in Sweden studying web development. This webpage is in fact part of a project in a course of the web development programme.

The source code of this website is hosted on GitHub, so if you want to help us build the website you can publish PR requests.
